      <p>
        CraftDesk Online started with a simple belief — creativity deserves
        the right tools. As students and creators ourselves, we often struggled
        to find quality stationery and craft supplies in one trusted place.
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as a small idea slowly turned into a platform built
        for students, artists, DIY lovers, and creative minds across India.
